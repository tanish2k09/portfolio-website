# First design of my personal portfolio website

Hosted at - [manku.dev](https://manku.dev)

Created with React and TailwindCSS

Designing an elegant, fun, interactive experience and showing informational content while establishing a personal brand identity was a hefty challenge.

Discord and Cuberto were my inspirations for this design.
